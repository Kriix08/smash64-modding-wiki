# Animation Exporting

Using GE you can export animations in the .bin and .fbx formats.

BIN animations are in the game's internal format.

FBX animations are in a format that can be edited in most 3d animation software. Note that GE exports in a proprietary FBX format that needs to be converted before being compatible with most 3d software. To convert the models, use NOESIS.
