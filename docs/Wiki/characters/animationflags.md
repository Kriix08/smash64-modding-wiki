# Animation Flags
Animation Flags are set when importing an animation. They define some settings that have effect ingame such as: root bone movement, ignore grab bone animation, etc.

Using unmatched settings when playing an animation can cause the game to crash.

Animation flags are set in the TODO textbox while importing an animation.
